## Project Setup

If you need to build the action locally, follow these steps for project setup:

### Prepare the Environment

```shell
python3 --version
```

### Set Up Python Environment

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Run Scripts Locally

If you need to run the scripts locally, follow these steps:

### Create the Shell Script

Create the shell file in the root directory. We will use `run_script.sh`.

```shell
touch run_script.sh
```

Add the shebang line at the top of the sh script file.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Essential environment variables for GitHub Action functionality
export INPUT_PATHS="jacoco.xml"
export INPUT_EXCLUDES="tests/*"
export INPUT_BASELINE_PATHS='
tests/data_baseline/**/*.xml
'

export INPUT_TITLE="Code Coverage Report"

export INPUT_GLOBAL_THRESHOLDS="80*80*80"

export INPUT_PR_NUMBER="1"                  # Required to add the PR number to receive the comments

export INPUT_METRICS="instruction"
export INPUT_COMMENT_LEVEL="full"

export INPUT_MODULES='
module_large: test_project/module_large
'
export INPUT_MODULES_THRESHOLDS='
module_large:80.0*95.0
'

export INPUT_SKIP_NOT_CHANGED="false"
export INPUT_UPDATE_COMMENT="false"
export INPUT_FAIL_ON_THRESHOLD="false"
export INPUT_DEBUG="false"

export INPUT_PASS_SYMBOL="‚úÖ"
export INPUT_FAIL_SYMBOL="‚ùå"

# Required Variables defined by GitHub - extras for local testing
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY="MoranaApps/jacoco-report-dev"
export GITHUB_EVENT_NAME="pull_request"
export GITHUB_REF="refs/pull/35/merge"

python3 main.py
```

### Make the Script Executable

From the terminal that is in the root of this project, make the script executable:

```shell
chmod +x run_script.sh
```

### Run the Script

```shell
./run_script.sh
```

## Run Pylint Check Locally

This project uses [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) tool for static code analysis.
Pylint analyses your code without actually running it.
It checks for errors, enforces, coding standards, looks for code smells etc.
We do exclude the `tests/` file from the pylint check.

Pylint displays a global evaluation score for the code, rated out of a maximum score of 10.0.
We are aiming to keep our code quality high above the score 9.5.

Follow these steps to run Pylint check locally:

### Set Up Python Environment

From terminal in the root of the project, run the following command:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will also install a Pylint tool, since it is listed in the project requirements.

### Run Pylint

Run Pylint on all files that are currently tracked by Git in the project.

```shell
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

To run Pylint on a specific file, follow the pattern `pylint <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py`.

Example:

```shell
pylint jacoco_report/jacoco_report.py
```

### Expected Output

This is the console expected output example after running the tool:

```shell
************* Module main
main.py:30:0: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)

------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 9.41/10 (previous run: 8.82/10, +0.59)
```

## Run Black Tool Locally

This project uses the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) tool for code formatting.
Black aims for consistency, generality, readability and reducing git diffs.
The coding style used can be viewed as a strict subset of PEP 8.

The project root file `pyproject.toml` defines the Black tool configuration.
In this project we are accepting the line length of 120 characters.
We also do exclude the `tests/` file from the black formatting.

Follow these steps to format your code with Black locally:

### Set Up Python Environment

From terminal in the root of the project, run the following command:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will also install a Black tool, since it is listed in the project requirements.

### Run Black

Run Black on all files that are currently tracked by Git in the project.

```shell
black $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

To run Black on a specific file, follow the pattern `black <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py`.

Example:

```shell
black jacoco_report/jacoco_report.py
```

### Expected Output

This is the console expected output example after running the tool:

```shell
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file reformatted.
```

---

## Run Unit Test

Unit tests are written using the Pytest framework. To run all the tests, use the following command:

```shell
pytest tests/
```

You can modify the directory to control the level of detail or granularity as per your needs.

To run a specific test, write the command following the pattern below:

```shell
pytest tests/utils/test_utils.py::test_make_issue_key
```

---

## Code Coverage

This project uses [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) plugin to generate test coverage reports.
The objective of the project is to achieve a minimal score of 80 %. We do exclude the `tests/` file from the coverage
report.

To generate the coverage report, run the following command:

```shell
pytest --cov=. tests/ --cov-fail-under=80 --cov-report=html -vv
```

See the coverage report on the path:

```shell
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Releasing

This project uses GitHub Actions for deployment draft creation. The deployment process is semi-automated by a workflow
defined in `.github/workflows/release_draft.yml`.

- **Trigger the workflow**: The `release_draft.yml` workflow is triggered on workflow_dispatch.
- **Create a new draft release**: The workflow creates a new draft release in the repository.
- **Finalize the release draft**: Edit the draft release to add a title, description, and any other necessary details
related to GitHub Action.
- **Publish the release**: Once the draft is ready, publish the release to make it available to the public.
